Packages used:

TODO for speed:
Make a package :)
Unit tests?
Define types more?
Sparse?
Have I overused modules?
IS there a tool to determine if functions and variables are unused?

Write some kind of unit-test?


Spline :
Does gradient have to take vectors?
do we use collect in the right ways.
Todo, make order input to spline

Time :

For speed it might be faster to have one function generating both K and S but tis will be way more ugly :(


Why does it not work as expected with the timefuncs?
Fix sub function defs
In the time stepper some stuff are computed several times, could be bad
Define types in struct
inline step- function
do not compute stuff several times
Sparse matrices?
Check how time integrators are implemented in the ODE-package



Is the K(t) = f(t)*K0 to slow???

Traceobjgrad:
MAKE A STRUCT FOR PRROBLEM PARAMS!!! Or how should it be done, it all appears very complicated
Weightf and penaltyf and omega should be an input parameters
Sumsq is probably wrong
Remove verbose?
