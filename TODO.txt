* Read in xi and fa frequencies. 
* Setting J_bar in myAdjointBraidApp::Preprocess will not be called in the first Braid_Drive instance. Instead only myAdjointBraidApp::Init. But I need to set the J_bar derivative in the initial conditions of the adjoint. Not sure what to do. Options:
    - make sure that braid_Drive() is called once before optimization.
    - pass J_bar through the app
    - adapt xbraid solveadjointwithbraid to do the grid initialization before the actual braid_Drive. 
* fix getParams() for FunctionOscillator!
