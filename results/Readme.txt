 * Ander's optimized control spline amplitudes for 2-oscillator, 2-level test case. 150 coefficients per control functions, 4 control functions. 
 * Ordering is (c1re, c2re, c1im, c2im) where c1re corresponds to the matrix (a1+a1.dag)
 * Reordered for my design storage being (c1re, c1im, c2re, c2im) in file cnot2-pcof-opt-alpha-0.15.dat.
